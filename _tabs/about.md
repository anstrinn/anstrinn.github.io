# Whoami

I'm a Linux user (Arch Linux, btw) who dives into the advanced ways of using it, day after day. Seeking for a solid and refined way to get non-stop productive. I'm quite a minimalist person, which loves to find better alternatives, and simple, to claim control and to protect myself from privacy concerning services and softwares.

I believe that the most simple things, the simplest projects and the tiny tools that solves problems are the most efficient. It's strange how the technology evolved to a bloated ecosystem whenever you look. That's why I embrace the command line, and how powerful it can be, despise it's simplicity of handling only text.

Currently building simple scripts that solves common problems, without the extra bloat.

# My Goal

My goal is to show how the tiny things are worth more.
