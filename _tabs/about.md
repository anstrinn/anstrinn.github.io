## Whoami

I'm a Linux user (Arch Linux, btw) who dives into the advanced ways of using it, day after day. Seeking for a solid and refined way to get non-stop productive. I'm also a cybersecurity enthusiast, or lunatic (you mean it).

Currently building an distraction-less environment by combining zen philosophies and a minimalist approach.

My goal is to show how the tiny things are worth more.

**Ask about:** Linux, Programming, Scripting, Automation and CLI.
